# Web-Scraping
This is an Excercise to get to get to know with Web Scraping concept in Python. I had to do this assignment as a part of my course "Advanced Python Programming" on https://maktabkhooneh.org

Write a program that takes the price and mileage of the first 20 people who sell a custom machine (the name of the machine is given at the input) from Truecar and stores it in a custom database.
